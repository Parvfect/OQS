# OQS
Open Quantum Systems shiz, focusing specifically on Lindblad Modelling of SQUID systems, but going to probably solve a lot of OQS problems along the way.

Currently Implementing a Lindblad time dependent and steady State simulation of a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device
xoxo Physics Final Year Project
